[{"content":"Correlation operation and random signal processing My midterm paper on probability theory and stochastic processes. This paper describes the concept of correlation operation, mainly introduces the application of correlation operation in random signal processing, including stationary random signal, blind source separation, template matching filter.

Based on the finite difference method , I proposed an ODE algorithm of non-uniform finite difference , and verified by Matlab simulation, the accuracy of the solution is improved by 10% . You can find this course paper in this pdf : A non-uniform node finite difference algorithm.\nIn addition , I made an academic poster for a simulated academic conference in the college.You can find in this pdf : Poster.\n","date":"2024-08-07T00:22:00+08:00","image":"https://example.com/post_file/non_uni_ode/cover1.png","permalink":"https://example.com/p/a-non-uniform-node-finite-difference-algorithm/","title":"A non-uniform node finite difference algorithm"},{"content":"SMLD and SDE Junjie Ma\u0026rsquo;s lab\u0026rsquo;s group meeting on August 1 .
